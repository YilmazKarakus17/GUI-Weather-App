# GUI-Weather-App
This repository contains design and prototype for an interactive user interface for showing information about current weather and weather forecasts on a mobile device (i.e. a Weather App)

## Responsiveness
Our app's UI adjusts for different screen widths, therefore it can be used on any mobile device as shown below.

## Weather App EDP & Current Weather Advice
Our Weather App has two unique functionality; our app calculates the current likelihood of the users electronic device receiving damage (EDP), and an advice for tackling the current weather.

### In the example below, we can see the current weather was rainy, therefore our app recommended the user take an umbrella. 
The algorithm uses current weather stats to decide on the most suitable response; for example, in windy weatherCancel changes conditions the app would recommend a carrying bag to reduce the likelihood of devices flying out of the users hand.

### In the second example, we can see the current weather is cloudy and so the user doesn't need any advice to tackle the weather.
Our advice popups use icons to summarise the advice given; for example, the smiley face icon signifies the current weather doesn't require any advice to tackle it.
This acts as a accelerator path as once users become experts they will recognise the meaning of these icons and won't have to read the messages.
